            I am a data analyst currently located in San Francisco, CA. I began my career as a cognitive psychologist, earning a Bachelor's in cognitive science from Carnegie Mellon University and a Master's in psychology from Bucknell University. During this time, I gained both class and research experience in Python, Excel, and Matlab. My research was focused on auditory psychology â€“ specifically, my undergraduate research studied <a href="http://icad.org/icad2017/icad2017_paper_53.pdf">human echolocation</a>, and my master's thesis studied <a href="https://digitalcommons.bucknell.edu/masters_theses/204/">auditory imagery in college students and senior citizens</a>. I presented the results of my work in oral presentations, posters, and written papers.
